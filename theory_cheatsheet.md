## Fundamental Frequency

I've read conflicting info here but as I understand it, 
The target tone produced by an impulse, which is 99% of the time the lowest note, however, some spl interactions in the room/instrument (we'll call it a resonance chamber) can produce new tones that are lower than the fundamental (undertones). 
So if C3 was the key I wanted to strike, the fundamental would be 258Hz, but Hz lower _could_ be produced, circumstantially. 

## Overtones
