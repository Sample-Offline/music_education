# DSP effects and the why/how?

## Gate

Gate lets signal of a certain dB through. (shout "let me in!" too softly and the guard doesnt open the gate. Yell super loud, and they do.). Dude in Act V intro stopping Baal was "the Gate".
If you dont shout loud enough, you still cant come in, even though the gates open. 

All the mic hiss, noise floor, and other shit has to stay outside. 

## Compressor

The too-drunk-guy-at-the-party. "Bro, simmer, you're too much right now."

## Glue Compressor

"Now kiss..." but for like, multiple track channels.

## Limiter

The bouncer. The compressor didn't catch you, so now I'm gonna MAKE you settle down. 

## EQ

The hype-man, esentially. Also like a conductor. You turn down, you turn up. It's all good. 

## Multiband Dynamics

Splits the signal into 3 bands to deal with. Each signal band can stand on its own. Like a filter splitter. The gym teacher who splits you into groups. 

## Noise Filter

Can be used as like a firewall to phase high-end bullshit. The higher the freq. the more chance of collision, so if you over-populate that range, you can tame some hard to catch rogue waves.

## Delay

TODO: This section needs some love. 

I kinda treat the delay as a signal repeater. All the coloring is delayed and sent on the same channels as the o.g. signal. It's beneficial cause it adds depth without adding additional coloration. The VHS cover of that Michael Keaton Multiplicity movie.

## Verb

Convo verb: Concreate, real space. (Think like, a big ol' venue)
Regular verb: Abstract space reflections. (Think like, a satin water wave in a dream or something)
