### How to calculate delay/reverb

1. Obtain your song's `bpm` and time signature.
2. Divide `60,000` by the `bpm` number.
3. Write down the result. This is the duration of the beat unit (quarter, eighth, etc.) used in the time signature expressed in `ms`.
4. **Multiply** or **divide** this result by two to obtain longer or shorter notes' lengths.
